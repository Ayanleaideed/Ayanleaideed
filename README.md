🌟 Hi there! I'm  Ayanle aideed.

📚 Proudly representing NDSU as a Computer Science student, I'm immersed in the world of algorithms, data structures, and late-night debugging.

🚀 As a Software Engineer, I've ventured into the realms of full-stack development, bridging the gap between pixel-perfect designs and robust backends.

💡 Curiosity drives me. Whether it's a new programming paradigm, a unique tech stack, or an unexpected solution to a common problem, I'm always on the lookout.

🤝 Let's connect, collaborate, and turn ideas into reality!
